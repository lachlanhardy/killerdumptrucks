    %h2 About this film

    %p <em>Attack of the Killer Dumptrucks</em> (1972) was the first in George Patterson&rsquo;s planned trilogy of construction-site themed horror films.

    %p Met with lukewarm critical reviews and largely ignored by mainstream cinemas &mdash; who felt its gory hydraulics and reflective-vested villains were unpalatable for audiences &mdash; Killer Dumptrucks disappeared from screens only ten days after release, bankrupting both Patterson and the studio bankrolling the production.

    %p It is believed a copy of the original print still exists in the basement of Patterson&rsquo;s house however since the financial ruin of the production he has refused all interviews, and now works in children&rsquo;s television.

    %p The only copy of Patterson&rsquo;s scripts for the two planned sequels, <em>Revenge of the Crane</em> and <em>Cement Mixer of Doom</em> were destroyed in a suspicious studio fire in 1974.
